This is the data for local classified advertisements. It has 9 prominent sections: jobs, resumes,
 gigs, personals, housing, community, services, for-sale and discussion forums. Each of these
  sections is divided into subsections called categories. For example, the services section has
   the following categories under it:
beauty, automotive, computer, household, etc.

For a set of sixteen different cities (such as newyork, Mumbai, etc.), we provide to you
 data from four sections

        for-sale
        housing
        community
        services

and we have selected a total of 16 categories from the above sections.

        activities
        appliances
        artists
        automotive
        cell-phones
        childcare
        general
        household-services
        housing
        photography
        real-estate
        shared
        temporary
        therapeutic
        video-games
        wanted-housing

Each category belongs to only 1 section.

About Data:

        city (string) : The city for which this Craigslist post was made.
        section (string) : for-sale/housing/etc.
        heading (string) : The heading of the post.

each of the fields have no more than 1000 characters. The input for the program has all the
 fields but category which you have to predict as the answer.

A total of approximately 20,000 records have been provided to you, proportionally represented 
across these sections, categories and cities. The format of training data is the same as input 
format but with an additional field "category", the category in which the post was made.

Task:

    Given the city, section and heading of an advertisement, can you predict the category under 
    which it was posted?
    Also Show top 5 categories which has highest number of posts


Q2. Facial Recognition + OpenCV Python

Facial recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying
 or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing.

Things that you need in this project: OpenCV and face_recognition

The project is mainly a method for detecting faces in a given image by using OpenCV-Python
 and face_recognition module. The first phase uses camera to capture the picture of our faces
  which generates a feature set in a location of your PC.

â€¢ The face_recognition command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for 
photographs.

It has two simple commands

Face_ recognition- Recognise faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.
face_detection - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.
For face recognition, first generate a feature set by taking few image of your face and create a
 directory with the name of person and save their face image.


Then train the data by using the Face_ recognition module.By Face_ recognition module the trained
 data is stored as pickle file (.pickle).

By using the trained pickle data, we can recognize face.

The main flow of face recognition is first to locate the face in the picture and the compare the
 picture with the trained data set.If the there is a match, it gives the recognized label.
