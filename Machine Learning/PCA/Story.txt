//Lets understand Association of inventory items at the stores to increase the 
sales and revenue

//For this how we can apply the machine learning
//For the simplest algo is Apriori (names comes from prior keyword)
//Most of the ecommerce companies use apriori along with other lot of algos and 
models to implement their recommendation systems
//Examples - amazon, myntra, flipkart, netflix

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. 
Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one’s needs and preferences. 
A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, 
while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. 
Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. 
If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:

1. Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be 
prompted to buy the other.
2. Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.
3. Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.
4. X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.
---------------------------------------------------
While we may know that certain items are frequently bought together, 
the question is, how do we uncover these associations?

Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. 
In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid 
can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.
---------------------------------------------------------------
//Association Rule Analysis
Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. 
There are three common ways to measure association.

Measure 1: 
Support. This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of 
transactions in which an itemset appears. 
In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. 
Itemsets can also contain multiple items. 
For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

//support_measure

If you discover that sales of items beyond a certain proportion tend to have a 
significant impact on your profits, you might consider using that proportion as 
your support threshold. You may then identify itemsets with support values above 
this threshold as significant itemsets.
=================================
Measure 2: Confidence. This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, 
expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, 
in which item Y also appears. 
In Table 1, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

//show image2_apriori
//confidene_measure

One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the 
importance of an association. 
This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. 
If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a 
transaction containing apples will also contain beers, 
thus inflating the confidence measure. 
To account for the base popularity of both constituent items, 
we use a third measure called lift.

======================================
Measure 3: Lift. This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, 
while controlling for how popular item Y is. 
In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. 

A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, 
while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

-------------------------------------------------------

Apriori Algorithm
The apriori principle can reduce the number of itemsets we need to examine. 
Put simply, the apriori principle states that if an itemset is infrequent, 
then all its subsets must also be infrequent. 
This means that if {beer} was found to be infrequent, 
we can expect {beer, pizza} to be equally or even more infrequent. 
So in consolidating the list of popular itemsets, we need not consider {beer, pizza}, 
nor any other itemset configuration that contains beer.

//two ways for apriorri
1. Finding itemsets with high support
2. Finding item rules with high confidence or lift

Finding rules with high confidence or lift is less computationally taxing 
once high-support itemsets have been identified, 
because confidence and lift values are calculated using support values.

//Where to download the library
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apyori/1.1.1

------------------------------------------------

The data we have is over 1 week (7 days)
min support - product is purchased atleast 3 times in a days
so support should be: 3*7/7500 ~ .003
