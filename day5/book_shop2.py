Code Challenge
  Name: 
    Book Shop
  Filename: 
    book_shop2.py
  Problem Statement:
    The same bookshop, but this time we work on a different list.
    
    The sublists of our lists look like this:
    [ordernumber, (article number, quantity, price per unit), 
    ... (article number, quantity, price per unit) ]
    
    Write a program which returns a list of two tuples with 
    (order number, total amount of order).
    [ 1, ("5464", 4, 9.99), ("8274",18,12.99), ("9744", 9, 44.95)], ... ]
    
  Hint: 
    use lambda, map and reduce concept to solve the problem  
    from functools import reduce
