  Problem Statement:
    You are given a 9 space separated numbers.                                 
    Write a python code to convert it into a 3x3 NumPy array of integers.      
  Input:
    6 9 2 3 5 8 1 5 4

  Problem Statement:
      To create an array of random e-commerce data of total amount spent per transaction. 
      Segment this incomes data into 50 buckets (number of bars) and plot it as a histogram.
      Find the mean and median of this data using NumPy package.
      Add outliers 
          
  Hint:
      Execute the code snippet below.
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      incomes = np.random.normal(100.0, 20.0, 10000)
      print (incomes)
 
    outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values 
    in a random sample from a population) to it to see their effect.
