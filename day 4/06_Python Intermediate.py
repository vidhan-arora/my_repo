## REAL WORLD USAGE OF SETS 
# Question: remove duplicate values from a list 
l1 = [1,2,3,1,2,3]

# You need to traverse the list one by one and create another empty list and 
# check whether it is present in that or no and add it 
# or a simple solution using sets which is more efficient then at logic

l2 = list ( set ( l1 ) ) 
print (l2)



# Real Life Example 
employees = ['Corey', 'Jim', 'Steven', 'April', 'Judy', 'Jenn', 'John', 'Jane' ]
gym_members = ['April', 'John', 'Corey']
developers = ['Judy', 'Corey', 'Steven', 'Jane', 'April']


  
#Question:  Which employers have gym membership and are also employees 
#Intersect gym members with developers 


result = set(gym_members).intersection(developers)
print (result)   # April and Corey 



#Question: All the employees who are not either gym members or developers 
#Difference between employees and gym members and developers 

result = set(employees).difference (gym_members, developers)
print (result)
# sets can replace a lot of membership tests 


# Frozensets

# Though sets can't contain mutable objects, sets are mutable: 
# Frozensets are like sets except that they cannot be changed, 
# i.e. they are immutable: 

cities = frozenset(["Frankfurt", "Basel","Freiburg"])
cities.add("Strasbourg")

    Mailing List
  Filename: 
    mailing.py
  Problem Statement:
  I recently decided to move a popular community  mailing list (3,000 subscribers, 
  60-80 postings/day) from my server to Google Groups. 
  I asked people to joint he Google-based list themselves, 
  and added many others myself, as the list manager. 
  However, after nearly a week, only half of the list had been moved. 
  I somehow needed to learn which people on the old list hadn't yet signed up for the new list.


  Fortunately, Google will let you export a list of members of a group to CSV format. 
  Also, Mailman (the list-management program I was using on
  my server) allows you to list all of the e-mail addresses being used 
  for a list. Comparing these lists, I think, offers a nice chance to look
  at several different aspects of Python, and to consider how we can 
  solve this real-world problem in a "Pythonic" way.


  The goal of this project is thus to find all of the e-mail addresses on 
  the old list that aren't on the new list. The old list is in a file 
  containing one e-mail address per line, as in:
